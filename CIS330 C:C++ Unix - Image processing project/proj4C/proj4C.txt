logger analysis:

When i analyzed the executing times of blender
and color between the images, the time grows
proportional to the number of pixels, because
the pixels of a 500 by 500 are 4 times greater
than 250 by 250 (ex. 250*250 = 62500, 500*500 = 250000),
the time will also be about 4 times greater.
Same goes with the execution time for color.
