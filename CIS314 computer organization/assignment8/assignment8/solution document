1. 16*16*4 = 1024

2. 128 misses

3. 128/1024 = 12.5%


Fundamental Parameters:

C = cache size in bytes
B = block size in bytes
m = address size in bits
E = lines per set, given by the "type" of cache (i.e. direct-mapped, X-way associative, fully-associative)

Derived Parameters:

1.) First we need to determine how many sets (denoted S) there will be. This comes from the following equation:
C=S⋅E⋅B

Example: 64 byte direct mapped cache with 4 byte blocks would have 16 sets

2.) Now we can figure out how many set bits (denoted s) we will need. This is given by the equation:

s=log2S

Example: Given 16 sets, we need 4 bits to address the sets

3.) Next we'll calculate the number of bits for the block offset, denoted $b:

b=log2B

Example: With 4 byte blocks, we need 2 bits in order to address any byte.

4.) Finally, we can calculate the tag bits (denoted t):

m=t+s+b

Example: With 32 bit addresses, the above example would have 26 bits for the tag.
